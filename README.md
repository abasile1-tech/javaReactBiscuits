# Tea & Biscuits with Spring API

- Our Tea and Biscuits app was built with React as a client and Express/MongoDB as a backend.
- However, our CTO has decided that a Spring API is a better option for scaling to millions of users!
- Your task is to create an API in Spring to replace the Express/MongoDB backend. 
- Do not change any code in the client code. 

The client app is in the folder `tea_and_biscuits_vite`


## Extentions

HINT: These will require code enhancments on the front-end and the back-end.

- Add a feature that allows the user to `delete` a tea or biscuit
- Add a feature that allows the user to `update` a tea or biscuit
